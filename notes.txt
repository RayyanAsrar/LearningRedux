------------------Redux and Redux toolkit------------------------
#What is Redux?
*Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. 
Think of it as a centralized place to store data that multiple components 
in your app need to access.

#Why Use Redux?
*Without Redux, in a React app:
    -You pass props down multiple levels (prop drilling) 😫
    -Siblings can't easily share data
    -Managing complex state becomes messy
--------Core Redux Concepts--------------------------------
1. Store
-The single centralized object that holds your entire application state.

// Think of it like this:
const store = {
  counterValue: 0,
  products: [],
  user: {},
  // ... all your app data
}

2. State
-The actual data stored in the store. It's just a JavaScript object.

3. Actions
-An action is a plain JavaScript object that has a type field.
You can think of an action as an event that describes something 
that happened in the application.

-The type field should be a string that gives this action a descriptive name,
like "todos/todoAdded". We usually write that type string like "domain/eventName",
where the first part is the feature or category that this action belongs to,
 and the second part is the specific thing that happened.

-An action object can have other fields with additional information 
about what happened. By convention, we put that information in a field
called payload.

example-
const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'todos/todoAdded',
  payload: 'Buy milk'
}

-Action Creators
An action creator is a function that creates and returns an action object. 
We typically use these so we don't have to write the action object by hand every time:
example-
const addTodo = text => {
  return {
    type: 'todos/todoAdded',
    payload: text
  }
}



4. Reducers
Pure functions that take the current state and an action,
 then return a new state. They specify how the state changes.
 
 // Simplified reducer concept
function reducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === "ADD") {
    return state + 1;
  }
  return state;
}
5. Dispatch
The function you call to send an action to the store.
dispatch(addTodo()); // This triggers the reducer
