------------------Redux and Redux toolkit------------------------
#What is Redux?
*Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. 
Think of it as a centralized place to store data that multiple components 
in your app need to access.

#Why Use Redux?
*Without Redux, in a React app:
    -You pass props down multiple levels (prop drilling) 😫
    -Siblings can't easily share data
    -Managing complex state becomes messy
--------Core Redux Concepts--------------------------------
1. Store
-The single centralized object that holds your entire application state.
The store is created by passing in a reducer, and has a method called getState that returns the current state value:

--example
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterReducer })
console.log(store.getState())
// {value: 0}


2. State
-The actual data stored in the store. It's just a JavaScript object.

3. Actions
-An action is a plain JavaScript object that has a type field.
You can think of an action as an event that describes something 
that happened in the application.

-The type field should be a string that gives this action a descriptive name,
like "todos/todoAdded". We usually write that type string like "domain/eventName",
where the first part is the feature or category that this action belongs to,
 and the second part is the specific thing that happened.

-An action object can have other fields with additional information 
about what happened. By convention, we put that information in a field
called payload.

example-
const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'todos/todoAdded',
  payload: 'Buy milk'
}

-Action Creators
An action creator is a function that creates and returns an action object. 
We typically use these so we don't have to write the action object by hand every time:
example-
const addTodo = text => {
  return {
    type: 'todos/todoAdded',
    payload: text
  }
}



4. Reducers
A reducer is a function that receives the current state and an action object,
decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the 
new state: (state, action) => newState. You can think of a reducer as an event listener
which handles events based on the received action (event) type.
--RULES OF REDUCERS 
-They should only calculate the new state value based on the state and action arguments
-They are not allowed to modify the existing state. Instead, they must make immutable updates,
 by copying the existing state and making changes to the copied values.
 **IN SIMPLE “If this action happens, how should the state change?”
--example
const initialState = { value: 0 }
function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  // Check to see if the reducer cares about this action
  if (action.type === 'counter/increment') {
    // If so, make a copy of `state`
    return {
      ...state,
      // and update the copy with the new value
      value: state.value + 1
    }
  }
  // otherwise return the existing state unchanged
  return state
}

5. Dispatch
The Redux store has a method called dispatch. The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch()
and pass in an action object. The store will run its reducer function and save the new state value inside,
and we can call getState() to retrieve the updated value:

6.Selectors
Selectors are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from a store state value. As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data:
example--
const selectCounterValue = state => state.value
const currentValue = selectCounterValue(store.getState())
console.log(currentValue)

7.slice
A slice is a bundle of:
        -State (the data)
        -Reducers (how the data changes)
        -Actions (auto-generated for you)


- in main.jsx u have to wrap ta app component inside provider which will come from 
react redux
- also configure store
